# autoresearch

This is an experiment to have the LLM do its own research.

## Setup

To set up a new experiment, work with the user to:

1. **Agree on a run tag**: propose a tag based on today's date (e.g. `mar5`). The branch `autoresearch/<tag>` must not already exist — this is a fresh run.
2. **Create the branch**: `git checkout -b autoresearch/<tag>` from current master.
3. **Read the in-scope files**: The repo is small. Read these files for full context:
   - `README.md` — repository context.
   - `prepare.py` — fixed constants, data prep, tokenizer, dataloader, evaluation. Do not modify.
   - `train.py` — the file you modify. Model architecture, optimizer, training loop.
4. **Verify data exists**: Check that `~/.cache/autoresearch/` contains data shards and a tokenizer. If not, tell the human to run `uv run prepare.py`.
5. **Initialize results.tsv**: Create `results.tsv` with just the header row. The baseline will be recorded after the first run.
6. **Confirm and go**: Confirm setup looks good.

Once you get confirmation, kick off the experimentation.

## Experimentation

Each experiment runs on a single GPU. The training script runs for a **fixed time budget of 5 minutes** (wall clock training time, excluding startup/compilation). You launch it simply as: `uv run train.py`.

**What you CAN do:**
- Modify `train.py` — this is the only file you edit. Everything is fair game: model architecture, optimizer, hyperparameters, training loop, batch size, model size, etc.

**What you CANNOT do:**
- Modify `prepare.py`. It is read-only. It contains the fixed evaluation, data loading, tokenizer, and training constants (time budget, sequence length, etc).
- Install new packages or add dependencies. You can only use what's already in `pyproject.toml`.
- Modify the evaluation harness. The `evaluate_bpb` function in `prepare.py` is the ground truth metric.

**The goal is simple: get the lowest val_bpb.** Since the time budget is fixed, you don't need to worry about training time — it's always 5 minutes. Everything is fair game: change the architecture, the optimizer, the hyperparameters, the batch size, the model size. The only constraint is that the code runs without crashing and finishes within the time budget.

**VRAM** is a soft constraint. Some increase is acceptable for meaningful val_bpb gains, but it should not blow up dramatically.

**Simplicity criterion**: All else being equal, simpler is better. A small improvement that adds ugly complexity is not worth it. Conversely, removing something and getting equal or better results is a great outcome — that's a simplification win. When evaluating whether to keep a change, weigh the complexity cost against the improvement magnitude. A 0.001 val_bpb improvement that adds 20 lines of hacky code? Probably not worth it. A 0.001 val_bpb improvement from deleting code? Definitely keep. An improvement of ~0 but much simpler code? Keep.

**The first run**: Your very first run should always be to establish the baseline, so you will run the training script as is.

## Output format

Once the script finishes it prints a summary like this:

```
---
val_bpb:          0.997900
training_seconds: 300.1
total_seconds:    325.9
peak_vram_mb:     45060.2
mfu_percent:      39.80
total_tokens_M:   499.6
num_steps:        953
num_params_M:     50.3
depth:            8
```

Note that the script is configured to always stop after 5 minutes, so depending on the computing platform of this computer the numbers might look different. You can extract the key metric from the log file:

```
grep "^val_bpb:" run.log
```

## Logging results

When an experiment is done, log it to `results.tsv` (tab-separated, NOT comma-separated — commas break in descriptions).

The TSV has a header row and 5 columns:

```
commit	val_bpb	memory_gb	status	description
```

1. git commit hash (short, 7 chars)
2. val_bpb achieved (e.g. 1.234567) — use 0.000000 for crashes
3. peak memory in GB, round to .1f (e.g. 12.3 — divide peak_vram_mb by 1024) — use 0.0 for crashes
4. status: `keep`, `discard`, or `crash`
5. short text description of what this experiment tried

Example:

```
commit	val_bpb	memory_gb	status	description
a1b2c3d	0.997900	44.0	keep	baseline
b2c3d4e	0.993200	44.2	keep	increase LR to 0.04
c3d4e5f	1.005000	44.0	discard	switch to GeLU activation
d4e5f6g	0.000000	0.0	crash	double model width (OOM)
```

## The experiment loop

The experiment runs on a dedicated branch (e.g. `autoresearch/mar5` or `autoresearch/mar5-gpu0`).

LOOP FOREVER:

1. Tune `train.py` with an experimental idea by directly hacking the code.
2. Run the Critic Sandbox: `python sandbox.py "Short description of what you changed"`
3. The sandbox will:
   - Lint the code for syntax checks.
   - Run the 5 minute experiment.
   - Extract `val_bpb` and `peak_vram_mb`.
   - Log the outcome directly to `results.tsv`.
   - Automatically `git commit` (if improved) or `git reset` (if degraded/crashed).
4. Read the `results.tsv` tail to understand what the Sandbox just did.
5. If the outcome was a crash you think you can easily fix (e.g., typo or minor syntax error seen in `run.log`), re-tune `train.py` and run the sandbox again.

The idea is that you are a completely autonomous researcher trying things out. The Sandbox handles the Git and execution discipline. If things work, the Sandbox keeps them. If they don't, the Sandbox discards them. If you feel like you're getting stuck in some way, review the code and brainstorm radically new directions.

**Timeout**: The Sandbox handles the timeout. If a run crashes (OOM or bug) and the Sandbox rolled back, read `run.log` to diagnose, adapt your idea, and quickly try again. If it is fundamentally broken, just skip it—the Sandbox already logged "crash"—and move on to a new idea.

**NEVER STOP**: Once the experiment loop has begun (after the initial setup), do NOT pause to ask the human if you should continue. Do NOT ask "should I keep going?" or "is this a good stopping point?". The human might be asleep, or gone from a computer and expects you to continue working *indefinitely* until you are manually stopped. You are autonomous. If you run out of ideas, think harder — read papers referenced in the code, re-read the in-scope files for new angles, try combining previous near-misses, try more radical architectural changes. The loop runs until the human interrupts you, period.

As an example use case, a user might leave you running while they sleep. If each experiment takes you ~5 minutes then you can run approx 12/hour, for a total of about 100 over the duration of the average human sleep. The user then wakes up to experimental results, all completed by you while they slept!
