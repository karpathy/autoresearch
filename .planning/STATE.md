# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-03-25)

**Core value:** AI agent autonomously discovers better ReID model configurations without human intervention
**Current focus:** Phase 01 — core-refactoring

## Current Position

Phase: 01 (core-refactoring) — EXECUTING
Plan: 3 of 3

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

- Total plans completed: 0
- Average duration: -
- Total execution time: 0 hours

**By Phase:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| - | - | - | - |

**Recent Trend:**

- Last 5 plans: -
- Trend: -

*Updated after each plan completion*

| Phase 01 P02 | 5min | 1 tasks | 1 files |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: 4-phase structure derived from requirement categories (REFAC -> INFRA -> AGNT -> VALD)
- Roadmap: Phase 1 is critical path -- the prepare.py/train.py split boundary is the hardest-to-change decision
- [Phase 01]: Used second PadToSquare (TF.pad) over broken first version (tf.pad)
- [Phase 01]: Builder functions accept transform/quality_degradation as params to avoid circular imports
- [Phase 01]: EPOCHS=10 (not 80), UNFREEZE_EPOCH=0 (not 5) -- train.py constants match autoresearch fixed budget

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Research gap: Exact timm version should be pinned before experiments for reproducible baselines
- Research gap: Teacher model selection (ONNX vs DINOv2) needs a decision before Phase 1 implementation
- Research gap: 10-epoch budget may need manual validation before committing
